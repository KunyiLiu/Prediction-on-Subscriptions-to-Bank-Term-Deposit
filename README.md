# Prediction-on-Subscriptions-to-Bank-Term-Deposit
The repository will contain the following files:  
data.csv : the actual data to be used  
hw3_starter_notebook.ipynb : the notebook to be used for providing the final analysis  
Data_dictionary.txt : file containing feature descriptions  

## Task
A banking institution ran a direct marketing campaign based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. Your task is to predict whether someone will subscribe to the term deposit or not based on the given information.  
** Visualization for Categorical Features **


## Step1 - Exploration and Preparation
In this step, I will perform the following actions:
1. check the imbalance in data
2. check missing values
3. understand the data better using plots
4. Perform basic feature engineering which will be used accross all model sets.
5. make some hypothesis using the plots and try to make some features representing them. Note that these features might/might not work because they are just hypothesis. 

## Step2 - ModelSet1 
In this step, we expect you to perform the following steps relevant to the models you choose for set1:
1. feature engineering
2. validation
3. feature selection
4. final model selection
In section you are supposed to test models apart from tree-based models, like SVM, Logistic Regression

## Step3 - ModelSet2
In section you are supposed to test tree-based models, like decision tree, random forest, gradient boosted trees, etc.

## Step4 - Ensemble 
In this step, we expect you to use the models created before and create new predictions. You should definitely try poor man's stacking but we encourage you to think of different ensemble techniques as well. We will judge your creativity and improvement in model performance using ensemble models and you can potentially earn 10 bonus points here.
